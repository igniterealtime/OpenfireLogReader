# OpenfileLogReader

The below information was from the original post on the Openfire boards. I (sethrandall) have since taken over the management of the code.

I didn’t find any program out there that suited my needs for a log reader to read the server audit logs, so I made one. I thought I’d share my work for anyone that might find it usefull.

Very simple to use:
Click on Open Log, browse to the log files from the server.

This populates the names on the left.

Click one of the names to show the messages to and from that person on the right.

Click a particular message on the right to show the entire message (if it is longer than visible) at the bottom.

No need to convert or edit the logs.

No need to know how many / what users there are.

Fast and simple.
